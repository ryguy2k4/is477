    "Its has been proposed that, instead of assigning UUIDs and storing the computed hash for verification purposes, that the hash itself can be used as an identifier. While not commonly used in data curation, content-based identifiers are widely used in other systems. For example, the Git version control system uses the concept of `commit hashes` to identify every version of every change in the repository.  Object stores often store files named based on a hash of their contents for storage efficiency, preventing storage of duplicate copies."
